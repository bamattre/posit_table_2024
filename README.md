# Posit Table Contest
My submission for Posit Table Contest 2024.

It's a pleasure but also a challenge to find good board games to play with my kids (7 and 3 years old).

I frequently browse [Board Game Geek](https://boardgamegeek.com/) to find new games, but it's hard to sift through thousands of games. So I created this table that allows me to filter by maximum age (for example getting games for ages 8 and below), number of players, time needed to play (2+ hours - no way), and other aspects like popularity and rating, theme and year published.
